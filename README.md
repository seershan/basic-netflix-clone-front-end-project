## Basic Netflix Clone

This is a basic clone of Netflix created as a practice project using HTML and CSS. It's a simple imitation of the Netflix interface and serves as a learning exercise.

### Features:
- Mimics the layout and design of Netflix using HTML and CSS.
- Simple and easy-to-understand code structure.
- Created with Visual Studio.

### Usage:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the Netflix clone.

### Future Plans:
I intend to create more practice projects similar to this one to improve my skills in web development.

### Credits:
This project was created by Seershan Mitra.
